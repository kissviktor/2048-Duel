<h1>2048-Duel</h1>

<p>It's a 2048 game with a twist: you can play with your friend locally and get rid of his/her tiles as you earn points/shots. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This one was my first bigger project, in which i wanted to create a multiplayer 2048 game with interesting features.<br>
In the original 2048 game, the players have infinite time to make decisions, but i wanted to shorten it via tower defense features, and special skills granted by Tiles (the bigger, the better) so it could work as a fast strategic logical game.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Howerer Python is not really suited for game developing and for example Unity would be a better choice, i wanted to learn the basics of Python and improve my skills, thats why its written in it.</p>

<h3>Game rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The basics are the same like in every 2048 game</li>
  <li>You earn points by merging the Tiles</li>
  <li>When you reach certain points, you'll earn shots, which are used to remove your opponent's Tiles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future improvements</h3>
<p>As i mentioned before, this game is just in the early stages</p>
<ul>
  <li>Online Multiplayer</li>
  <li>Coop vs AI / Player vs Player, tower defense like game mode</li>
  <li>Pre-selected Tile types, which are affecting the match outcomes</li>
</ul>
